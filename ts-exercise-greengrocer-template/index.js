/*

This is how an item object should look like

{
  id: "001-beetroot", // <- the item id matches the icon name in the assets/icons folder
  name: "beetroot",
  price: 0.35 // <- You can come up with your own prices
}

Create a new project using Vite, and select the vanilla/vanilla-ts template

Remember you can type objects as follows 

const obj: {
  greeting: string; //I'm saying there's a key named greeting, with the type string
  count: number;
} = {
  greeting: "hello",
  count: 1,
};

*/
